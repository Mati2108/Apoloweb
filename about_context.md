# About

KiFrames was born out of frustration and necessity. As a creator juggling music production and video editing, I constantly ran into the same problem: organizing files should be simple, but it never is. Most tools are clunky, slow, or built for someone else.

So I decided to build my own.

KiFrames isn't backed by a big company or built in a boardroom. It's designed by a creator, for creators — tools I genuinely needed in my own workflow.

We’re starting small: tools that help you stay organized, move faster, and focus on what matters — creating.

If you're a creator like me — welcome.  
Whether you're a music producer tired of losing track of samples, a video creator drowning in media files, or any kind of creator who understands the struggle of staying organized while staying creative — these tools are made for you.
